# PowerShell for Advanced Lateral Movement Evasion and Stealth


## Detailed Analysis – PowerShell for Advanced Lateral Movement Evasion and Stealth

### Objective

**Detect and respond to highly stealthy, advanced techniques where attackers use PowerShell for lateral movement while intentionally avoiding conventional detection.** This use case focuses on methods blending into administrative "noise," leveraging trusted parent processes, obfuscation, and “living off the land” binaries for movement across an enterprise[^12_7][^12_12].

### MITRE ATT\&CK Mapping

- **T1021** – Remote Services (SMB/WinRM/PsExec/WMI)
- **T1217** – Browser Bookmark Discovery (used in pivots)
- **T1070** – Indicator Removal on Host (cleanup/anti-forensics)
- **T1059.001** – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell


### Why It Matters

- **Attackers increasingly refine lateral movement** to evade endpoint security tools, advanced threat analytics, and behavioral monitoring.
- **“Stealthy” methods** use legitimate schedule/task creation, registry editing, or remote WMI to move *and* persist without obvious signs.
- These methods often **fly under the radar** of most standard SIEM/EDR correlation rules unless defenders baseline real, day-to-day admin behavior.


### Stealthy Lateral Movement Techniques (PowerShell Focus)

- **WinRM/PowerShell Remoting:** Leveraging enterprise-grade PowerShell remoting with legitimate accounts, blending into allowed admin flows[^12_6][^12_7].
- **WMI + PowerShell:** Executing PowerShell code remotely through WMI, which can be harder to detect than direct remoting commands[^12_2][^12_7].
- **Remote Scheduled Tasks:** Creating tasks using PowerShell (`schtasks.exe`) on target machines to launch payloads at specific times[^12_7][^12_12].
- **PsExec \& "Living off the Land":** Using signed binaries (e.g., `PsExec`, `wmic`, `regsvr32`, etc.) to run PowerShell remotely, thus evading many script-detection tools[^12_2][^12_8][^12_12].
- **Remote Registry Modification:** Exploiting Windows's remote registry APIs via PowerShell to deploy persistence mechanisms—turning persistence tricks into lateral movement attacks[^12_12].
- **Parent Process Masquerading:** Launching PowerShell via trusted parent processes, such as update managers or software installers, as seen in supply chain scenarios, but applied for lateral movement[^12_12].
- **Credential/Token Abuse \& Chaining:** Stealing cached tokens or creating tokens for other sessions, using PowerShell to automate token impersonation and movement[^12_1][^12_11].


### Example Attack Flow (Advanced Evasion)

1. **Initial Access:** Attacker uses phishing or exploits to compromise an endpoint with standard user privileges.
2. **Reconnaissance:** Maps network using PowerShell and built-in tools (`netstat`, `arp`, `Get-NetTCPConnection`)[^12_11].
3. **Token or Session Hijack:** Obtains high privileges/token via credential theft/logon session abuse.
4. **WinRM or WMI Move:** Launches PowerShell code on a peer system via WinRM, WMI, or scheduled task, using legitimate admin credentials.
5. **Persistence and Hidden C2:** Hides persistence by modifying remote registry or installing tasks under system tools, often via PowerShell.
6. **Anti-Forensics:** Cleans up logs/events via PowerShell commands (`clear-eventlog`, `remove-item`), deletes script blocks after execution.

### Detection Logic \& SIEM/EDR Queries

#### **Splunk (SPL)**

Detecting stealthy lateral movement using PowerShell with noisy “living off the land” techniques:

```splunk
index=main (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=4104)
process="powershell.exe" AND (
    (parent_process="wmiprvse.exe" OR parent_process="svchost.exe" OR parent_process="taskeng.exe" OR parent_process="schtasks.exe") OR
    CommandLine="*New-ScheduledTask*" OR
    CommandLine="*Invoke-WmiMethod*" OR
    CommandLine="*WinRM*" OR 
    CommandLine="*-EncodedCommand*" OR
    CommandLine="*clear-eventlog*" OR
    CommandLine="*remove-item*"
)
```


#### **CrowdStrike Falcon Query**

```crowdstrike
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| search TargetFileName="powershell.exe"
AND (
    ParentBaseFileName IN ("wmiprvse.exe","svchost.exe","taskeng.exe","schtasks.exe") OR
    CommandLine="*Invoke-WmiMethod*" OR
    CommandLine="*WinRM*" OR
    CommandLine="*New-ScheduledTask*" OR
    CommandLine="*EncodedCommand*" OR
    CommandLine="*clear-eventlog*"
)
```


#### **ELK Stack (Lucene)**

```lucene
process_name:"powershell.exe" AND (
    parent_process_name:("wmiprvse.exe" OR "svchost.exe" OR "taskeng.exe" OR "schtasks.exe") OR
    process_command_line:("Invoke-WmiMethod" OR "WinRM" OR "New-ScheduledTask" OR "EncodedCommand" OR "clear-eventlog" OR "remove-item")
)
```


### Incident Response Steps

| Step | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Immediate Contain | Isolate any host with suspicious parent-child or lateral PowerShell linkage. |
| Timeline Review | Correlate script block/process logs, especially parented by system services or tasks. |
| Log Hunt | Search for anti-forensic/cleanup PowerShell commands (log clearing, file deletion). |
| Persistence Sweep | Review scheduled tasks, remote registry changes, new services, or logon events created remotely. |
| Privilege Tracking | Map all token/credential use, session creation, and delegation across hosts. |
| Post-Mortem | Baseline normal admin activity, refine alert rules, and update allowlists where needed. |

### Hardening \& Best Practices

- **Baseline Legitimate Admin Behavior:** Profile regular parent-child process, task, registry, and scheduled task operations to minimize false positives.
- **Monitor for Trusted System Process Launching PowerShell:** Alert on unexpected parent processes (WMI, scheduled tasks).
- **Enable Script Block and Module Logging:** Centralized collection and frequent review for subtle anti-forensic actions.
- **Alert on Anti-Forensic Activities:** Deletions of logs, script block cleaning, etc.
- **Least Privilege Principle:** Restrict remote admin privileges, and alert on unusual remote PowerShell task/registry actions.
- **SIEM Correlation Logic:** Chain multiple signals—parent process, command line keywords, anti-forensic ops—to reduce alert fatigue and catch advanced attacks.
- **Red Team Exercises:** Routinely test SIEM/EDR coverage with stealthy movement techniques to validate the fidelity and scope of detections.


### Infographic: Stealthy Lateral Movement via PowerShell [interpret as in-text]

1. **Initial Compromise**
2. **Recon/Network Mapping with PowerShell**
3. **Token Theft \& Priv Esc**
4. **Remoting via WinRM/WMI/Scheduled Tasks/Registry**
5. **Payload Execution under Trusted Parent Process**
6. **Cleanup, Anti-Forensics, Next Host**

**Advanced attackers increasingly use stealthy, “living off the land” PowerShell-driven lateral movement by hiding among legitimate admin actions. Only thoughtful baseline analysis, tight privilege controls, and correlated detection rules can reliably surface these high-risk, high-impact events in modern environments.**[^12_7][^12_12][^12_11]
