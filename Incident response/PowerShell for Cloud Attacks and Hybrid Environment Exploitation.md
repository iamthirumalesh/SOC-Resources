# PowerShell for Cloud Attacks and Hybrid Environment Exploitation


## Detailed Analysis – PowerShell for Cloud Attacks and Hybrid Environment Exploitation

### Objective

**Detect and respond to malicious or suspicious PowerShell activity targeting cloud resources, hybrid Active Directory (AD)/Azure AD environments, and SaaS applications.** Attackers increasingly use PowerShell modules and scripts to enumerate, manipulate, or compromise cloud-based infrastructure from both on-premises and remote endpoints.

### MITRE ATT\&CK Mapping

- **T1087.004** – Cloud Account Discovery
- **T1098** – Account Manipulation (e.g., adding users, roles)
- **T1110.003** – Brute Force: Password Spraying
- **T1204** – User Execution (malicious O365/Teams link, macro, etc.)
- **T1059.001** – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell


### Why It Matters

- PowerShell supports numerous cloud management modules (e.g., **AzureAD**, **MSOnline**, **ExchangeOnline**, **AWS Tools**).
- Credential theft, privilege escalation, and resource enumeration can be conducted remotely—with little/no footprint on cloud side.
- Hybrid AD environments are common; attackers use PowerShell to bridge on-prem and cloud for persistence, lateral movement, and exfiltration.


## Detection Logic \& Practical Queries for SIEM/EDR

### Key Suspicious Behaviors

- PowerShell running **cloud management cmdlets** (e.g., `Connect-AzAccount`, `Get-MsolUser`, `Get-AzureADUser`)
- Unusual authentication attempts (from unfamiliar endpoints/IPs) against cloud services
- Enumeration of cloud tenants, users, groups, roles, applications, or mailbox data
- Credential dumping or token export commands (e.g., `Get-AzureADUserToken`)
- Bulk cloud user modifications, role assignments, password resets via script


### Detection Queries: Splunk, CrowdStrike, and ELK

#### **Splunk Search Example**

Detect suspicious use of cloud-related PowerShell modules/commands:

```splunk
index=main (EventCode=4104 OR EventCode=4688)
process="powershell.exe" AND (
    CommandLine="*Connect-AzAccount*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-AzureADUser*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-MsolUser*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-EXOMailbox*" OR
    CommandLine="*Set-AzureADUserPassword*" OR
    CommandLine="*Add-MsolRoleMember*"
)
```

- Filter for never-before-seen hosts/users, or spike in cloud cmdlet usage.


#### **CrowdStrike Falcon Query Example**

Detect PowerShell cloud management activity and automation attacks:

```crowdstrike
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| search TargetFileName="powershell.exe"
AND (
    CommandLine="*Connect-AzAccount*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-AzureADUser*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-MsolUser*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-EXOMailbox*" OR
    CommandLine="*Add-MsolRoleMember*"
)
```

- Enrich with network connection data; flag public/non-corporate source IPs and administrative cloud actions.


#### **ELK Stack (Lucene) Query Example**

```lucene
process_name:"powershell.exe" AND process_command_line:("Connect-AzAccount" OR "Get-MsolUser" OR "Get-AzureADUser" OR "Get-EXOMailbox" OR "Set-AzureADUserPassword" OR "Add-MsolRoleMember")
```

- Use timeline pivots/highlight abnormal cloud admin actions (correlate with process/network logs for full visibility).


## Attack Flow Scenario

1. **Initial Compromise**
    - Attacker compromises a hybrid-joined workstation or VPN-connected laptop.
2. **Cloud Account Enumeration**
    - Runs PowerShell with `Connect-AzAccount`, `Get-MsolUser`, `Get-AzureADDirectoryRole`.
3. **Privilege Escalation or Abuse**
    - Adds attacker account to admin role (`Add-MsolRoleMember`), resets target user password, or steals tokens via script.
4. **Data Exfiltration / Manipulation**
    - Uses `Get-EXOMailbox` or `Export-Mailbox` PowerShell commands to access and export critical mailbox data.
5. **Persistence**
    - Creates backdoor accounts, application registrations, or modifies MFA/conditional access settings—all with PowerShell modules.

## Infographic: PowerShell Cloud Attack Chain

1. **Initial Host/Cloud Compromise**
2. **Cloud Credential Harvesting** (Connect-* commands)
3. **Directory/Role/Group Enumeration**
4. **Privilege Escalation in Cloud**
5. **Data Access/Exfiltration**
6. **Cloud Persistence/Backdoors**

## Incident Response and Recommendations

| Step | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Contain/Disable | Isolate host and disable suspicious accounts in both on-prem \& cloud directories. |
| Federated Log Review | Examine both endpoint process logs **and** corresponding cloud audit logs. |
| Token Hunt | Search for exported tokens, consent grants, or password changes via PowerShell. |
| Investigate Role Changes | Review changes to roles/groups in Azure AD, O365, Google/AWS IAM, etc. |
| Remediation | Remove rogue accounts/permissions, enforce password and MFA reset where required. |
| Correlate Actions | Trace hybrid attacks: endpoint events → cloud actions → exfil, escalation. |

## Hardening \& Best Practices

- **Restrict PowerShell Module Use**: Allow cloud cmdlets only for authorized admin jump hosts.
- **Alert on Risky Cloud Commands**: Block/alert on commands like `Add-MsolRoleMember`, `Set-AzureADUserPassword`, especially from new devices.
- **Monitor for Bulk Cloud Actions**: Use SIEM or CASB to watch for spikes in user creates/updates, role assignments, and mailbox exports.
- **Federated Logging**: Combine endpoint SIEM/EDR with cloud-native audit logs for full context (Azure/AWS/Google logs).
- **Apply Conditional Access \& MFA**: Require strong authentication, especially for cloud PowerShell sessions.
- **User/Admin Training**: Train on hybrid/cloud security threats and detection response protocols.

**Proactive correlation between endpoint and cloud telemetry—using PowerShell-focused queries and automated detection logic—is essential for uncovering advanced persistent attacks that bridge the on-prem/cloud gap.**

## Detailed Analysis: Use Case 9 – PowerShell in Ransomware Attacks and Automated Destruction

### Objective

**Detect and defend against the abuse of PowerShell in ransomware incidents and other automated destructive attacks.** Attackers use PowerShell to rapidly deploy, stage, or execute file encryption, data destruction, exfiltration, and anti-forensic actions—often targeting hundreds or thousands of machines in minutes.

### MITRE ATT\&CK Mapping

- **T1486** – Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)
- **T1485** – Data Destruction
- **T1059.001** – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **T1070** – Indicator Removal on Host (anti-forensic log/object cleaning)


### Why It Matters

- Modern ransomware campaigns (Ryuk, Conti, LockerGoga, etc.) **leverage PowerShell for speed and stealth**, often using encoded or obfuscated payloads.
- Attackers use PowerShell to **automate mass encryption/destruction**, control lateral movement, kill security tools, and erase evidence.
- The same patterns may appear in wiper malware and espionage campaigns seeking maximum damage.


## Detection Logic \& Practical Queries

### Key Suspicious Behaviors:

- PowerShell execution of known ransomware binaries, or scripts containing `AES`, `Encrypt`, or file enumeration logic.
- Bulk deletion or renaming of files (including shadow copies, backups) initiated by PowerShell.
- Commands disabling shadow copy backups:
    - `vssadmin delete shadows`, `wmic shadowcopy delete`, or via PowerShell-invoked COM objects.
- PowerShell disabling or stopping AV/security tools before file operations.
- File operations by PowerShell with massive object/file counts in short timeframes.
- Use of archive/compression in combination with PowerShell (e.g., `Compress-Archive`, `Add-Type` with encryption routines).


### Detection Queries

#### **Splunk (SPL) Example**

Detect PowerShell involving ransomware-like activity, file encryption, shadow copy deletion:

```splunk
index=main (EventCode=4104 OR EventCode=4688)
process="powershell.exe" AND (
    CommandLine="*vssadmin delete shadows*" OR
    CommandLine="*Remove-Item*" OR
    CommandLine="*cipher.exe*" OR
    CommandLine="*Compress-Archive*" OR
    CommandLine="*AES*" OR
    CommandLine="*Encrypt*" OR
    CommandLine="*bcdedit*" OR
    CommandLine="*Stop-Process*" OR
    CommandLine="*defender*"
)
```

- Pivot on event count per host, file operations rate, and parent/child process correlations.


#### **CrowdStrike Falcon Query Example**

```crowdstrike
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| search TargetFileName="powershell.exe" AND (
    CommandLine="*vssadmin delete shadows*" OR
    CommandLine="*cipher.exe*" OR
    CommandLine="*Compress-Archive*" OR
    CommandLine="*AES*" OR
    CommandLine="*Encrypt*" OR
    CommandLine="*Remove-Item*" OR
    CommandLine="*bcdedit*" OR
    CommandLine="*Stop-Process*"
)
```

- Filter for unusual spawns (e.g. not from admin consoles), bulk execution, or runs from non-admin users.


#### **ELK Stack (Lucene) Example**

```lucene
process_name:"powershell.exe" AND process_command_line:("vssadmin delete shadows" OR "cipher.exe" OR "Compress-Archive" OR "AES" OR "Encrypt" OR "Remove-Item" OR "bcdedit" OR "Stop-Process" OR "defender")
```

- Extend with timeline analytics: high counts of Remove-Item/Encrypt in <10 mins, shadow copy deletion.


## Ransomware/Destruction Attack Flow

1. **Initial Foothold:** Phishing, RDP compromise, or (more often) prior privilege escalation.
2. **Weaponization:** PowerShell script fetched, often encoded, staged via C2.
3. **Defense Evasion:** PowerShell disables AV and deletes shadow copies/backups.
4. **Execution:** PowerShell iterates drives, folders, and encrypts or deletes data.
5. **Cleanup:** Logs, backups, and vital records are deleted (anti-forensics).
6. **Ransom Note/Extortion:** Dropping of ransom notice or extortion script.
7. **Optional Data Exfiltration:** PowerShell used to zip files and upload to attacker-controlled site (not always present).

## Infographic: PowerShell-Powered Ransomware Attack Chain

1. **Initial Compromise**
2. **PowerShell Download/Execution (often encoded)**
3. **Security Tool/Backup Destruction**
4. **Parallel File Encryption/Deletion (mass file operations)**
5. **Ransom Note \& Optional Exfiltration**
6. **Host/Data Rendered Useless**

## Incident Response Steps

| Step | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Isolate | Immediately remove affected hosts from the network. |
| Triage | Gather all PowerShell, process, and file event logs. |
| Hunt | Identify all endpoints with matching PowerShell ransomware behaviors. |
| Backup Sweep | Check for intact, offline, or immutable backups; verify volume shadow status. |
| Tool Review | Inspect AV, shadow copies, and related service status for mass disabling. |
| Forensics | Use PowerShell logs to reconstruct encryption/destruction timeline/IIDs. |
| Recovery | Restore from secure backups; reset credentials used in initial attack. |

## Hardening \& Recommendations

- **Alert on mass file operations** from PowerShell. No legitimate admin task should rapidly rename or delete thousands of files.
- **Block PowerShell execution** from non-admin/unauthorized users, especially on workstations.
- **Enable Script Block and Module Logging** for all hosts; centralize and monitor for mass file ops and `vssadmin` commands.
- **Restrict access** to `vssadmin`, `bcdedit`, and backup settings via GPO/AppLocker/WDAC.
- **Monitor AV/service tampering commands** and rapid service restarts/stops.
- **Apply application allowlisting** for PowerShell scripts.
- **User, backup, and RDP hygiene:** Patch, train, and enforce least-privilege principle.
- **Isolate and harden backups:** Keep them offline or immutable whenever possible.


## Threat Hunting \& Blue Team Tips

- **Hunt for anomalous file operation rates** (file creation, deletion, modification) tied to `powershell.exe` in EDR/SIEM.
- **Alert and investigate scripts that include or obfuscate common crypto terms** (`AES`, `Encrypt`, `Rijndael`, `ConvertTo-SecureString`).
- **Audit VSS and AV logs** for disabling attempts.
- **Correlate across endpoints** for simultaneous attacks—wide-scale PowerShell execution = major incident.

**Stopping PowerShell-driven ransomware and destruction attacks before encryption/erasure completes requires rapid detection of telltale behaviors—mass file operations, AV tampering, shadow copy deletion—paired with aggressive isolation, forensics, and immutable backups. Modern SIEM and EDR with strong PowerShell command line/process arguments analytics is critical for success.**
