# PowerShell for Threat Hunting and Security Monitoring


## Detailed Analysis: – PowerShell for Threat Hunting and Security Monitoring

### Objective

**Leverage PowerShell for active threat hunting, detection of anomalies, and enhanced cyber defense.** This use case covers real-time identification of malicious activity, artifact discovery, and support for blue team operations using PowerShell’s automation, investigation, and enrichment capabilities.

### MITRE ATT\&CK Mapping

- **T1059.001** – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **T1070** – Indicator Removal on Host (e.g., clearing logs)
- **T1086** – PowerShell (legacy tech ID, still referenced)
- **T1047** – Windows Management Instrumentation


### Why It Matters

PowerShell is a dual-use tool. Defenders can use it **proactively** to:

- Identify suspicious processes, network connections, scripts, and files[^8_1][^8_2].
- Automate the collection, correlation, and enrichment of diverse telemetry (logs, events, process metadata)[^8_3][^8_1].
- Quickly respond to emerging threats while performing forensics, live response, or ad hoc investigations.

Attackers commonly leverage evasion and anti-forensics—defenders must respond with equally agile and automated detection logic.

## Detection Logic \& Practical Queries for SIEM/EDR

### Key Suspicious Behaviors for Threat Hunting

- **Script block logging with suspicious keywords** (e.g., `Invoke-Mimikatz`, `clear-eventlog`, `remove-item`).
- **Unusual process parent-child relationships or encoded command lines.**
- **Rapid or high-volume enumeration from unusual user accounts.**
- **Clearing, tampering, or deleting logs using PowerShell.**


### Detection Queries: Splunk, CrowdStrike, and ELK

#### **Splunk Search Example**

```splunk
index=main (EventCode=4104 OR EventCode=4688)
process="powershell.exe" AND (
    CommandLine="*clear-eventlog*" OR
    CommandLine="*remove-item*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-Process*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-NetTCPConnection*" OR
    CommandLine="*Set-ExecutionPolicy*"
)
```

- Add time-window and user correlation for advanced hunting.
- Use for rapid detection of anti-forensic or suspicious activities like log clearing.


#### **CrowdStrike Falcon Query Example**

```crowdstrike
event_simpleName=ProcessRollup2
| search TargetFileName="powershell.exe"
AND (
    CommandLine="*clear-eventlog*" OR
    CommandLine="*remove-item*" OR
    CommandLine="*Get-Process*" OR
    CommandLine="*get-msoluser*" OR
    CommandLine="*Invoke-Obfuscation*"
)
```

- Pivot by initiator (user, device), timestamp, and parent process for enrichment.


#### **ELK Stack (Lucene) Query Example**

```lucene
process_name:"powershell.exe" AND process_command_line:("clear-eventlog" OR "remove-item" OR "Get-Process" OR "Get-NetTCPConnection" OR "Set-ExecutionPolicy")
```

- Combine with suspicious parent events or rapid-fire repetition for high-fidelity hunting.


## Attack Flow Scenario: Threat Hunter’s Perspective

1. **Initial Detection:** Blue team detects `powershell.exe` spawning with `-EncodedCommand` from a non-admin user account.
2. **Automated Enrichment:** Scripts correlate logon events, parent process, and timeline proximity of file deletion or log clearing.
3. **Deep Dive:** Analyst executes live PowerShell queries to enumerate all network connections (`Get-NetTCPConnection`), running processes, and checks process paths for anomalies.
4. **Pivot \& Response:** Suspicious processes terminated, lateral movement tracked across hosts using automation.
5. **Post Incident:** All new detection logic (e.g., log clearing attempts, C2 beacons) is tuned and added to the SIEM for continuous use.

## Infographic: PowerShell Threat Hunting Workflow

1. **Proactive Log Collection:** Monitor 4104 (ScriptBlock), 4688 (Process Creation), Sysmon, EDR events.
2. **Enrichment Scripts:** Use PowerShell to correlate process, user, and network data.
3. **Detection Triggers:** Alert on encoded commands, anti-forensic activity, suspicious enumeration.
4. **Analyst Response:** Live query endpoints, isolate hosts, terminate rogue processes.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Update SIEM rules with new IOCs or TTPs discovered during hunt.

## Incident Response and Recommendations

| Step | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Log Aggregation | Ensure comprehensive collection of PowerShell, process, and network logs. |
| Threat Hunt | Execute live PowerShell queries for process/file/network anomalies. |
| Threat Scoring | Use risk-based scoring on each execution (e.g., frequency, context, command used)[^8_4]. |
| Containment | Isolate endpoints showing malicious PowerShell activity. |
| Reporting | Document findings, update SIEM correlation rules. |

**Hunting Tips:**

- Use allow-lists of known, benign scripts/processes.
- Pivot on rare parent-child process relationships (e.g., notepad.exe → powershell.exe).
- Investigate encoded, obfuscated, or excessive PowerShell executions from regular user accounts.


## Hardening \& Best Practices

- **Enable Script Block and Module Logging:** Full command/script visibility[^8_4][^8_2].
- **Alert on Anti-Forensic Activity:** Clearing logs, modifying event records, or mass deletion.
- **Use Baseline* analytics:** Detect abnormal volume/speed of enumeration or process executions.
- **Apply Least-Privilege:** Enforce PowerShell restrictions for non-admins.
- **Educate Users \& Admins:** Training on the detection and response process using PowerShell.

PowerShell provides both attackers and defenders with formidable powers. Successful blue teams automate detection, triage, and enrichment—using PowerShell itself—to counter the advanced and evolving TTPs adversaries employ in the modern cyber threat landscape[^8_3][^8_1][^8_5][^8_2][^8_6].
