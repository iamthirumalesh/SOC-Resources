# **My First Real-World Incident Response Story**

Every cybersecurity professional remembers their first real-world incident response. For me, it wasn’t just a technical challenge—it was a transformative experience that taught me about the chaos, intensity, and satisfaction of chasing down an active threat. Let me take you behind the scenes of that night.

### **The Incident: A Late-Night Alert**

It was late on a Tuesday—one of those nights when the glow of the monitor seems the only source of light. My phone pulsed with an urgent alert from our SIEM: unusual network traffic streaming from an internal server. The patterns pointed to possible data exfiltration. Instantly, a rush of adrenaline surged through me. My role had shifted from routine defense to front-line responder. I was now responsible for protecting our data, our reputation, and even our jobs.

### **The Investigation: Diving Into the Digital Trenches**

I wasted no time. My first step was to gather context—who, what, when, where, how. The logs hinted at strange outbound connections, so I launched two of my favorite forensic tools: **Sysmon** for system-level telemetry and **Wireshark** for network packet inspection.

#### **Using Sysmon Filters: Finding the Needle**

Sysmon provides granular event logging, and the key is to filter through the noise:

- **Event ID 3 (Network Connections):** I filtered for unusual destinations using:

  ```
  EventID=3 AND (DestinationIP != "Internal Subnets")
  ```
  
  This quickly revealed several outbound connections to an external, unfamiliar IP, occurring at odd hours.

- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** I checked for processes initiating these connections:

   ```
  EventID=1 AND (CommandLine CONTAINS "powershell" OR "cmd.exe") AND (ParentImage CONTAINS "svchost.exe")
  ```
   
  Here, a PowerShell process with an obfuscated script stood out—it had launched from an RDP session, indicating compromise.

#### **Wireshark: Following the Data Trail**

Switching to Wireshark, I loaded the pcap files filtered by the server’s IP. I used filters like:

```
ip.addr ==  && !(ip.dst==192.168.0.0/16)
```

This excluded local traffic, letting me focus on communication with external hosts.

I honed in on the suspicious flows using:

```
tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 80
```

and then

```
frame contains "POST" || frame contains "GET"
```

I saw encrypted POST requests sent at intervals matching the SIEM alert, each carrying payloads whose sizes were consistent with sensitive database chunks.

Cross-referencing timestamps between Wireshark and Sysmon logs, I pieced together the timeline: After establishing the initial foothold via RDP, the adversary launched a PowerShell script that started siphoning data—slowly and quietly.

### **Containment: Racing the Clock**

Time was the enemy. I enacted the incident response playbook:

- **Isolation:** Pulled the server’s network cable—no exfiltration could continue.
- **Memory Dump:** Used FTK Imager to secure a live memory image for malware analysis.
- **Rootkit & Backdoor Search:** Ran in-depth scans using Sysinternals Suite; found registry modifications and a scheduled task leading to the attacker’s script.

### **Root Cause Analysis: Tracing the Breach**

Further Sysmon log review traced the attacker’s point of entry to an unpatched RDP vulnerability. The event logs revealed out-of-hours login from an external IP, followed by privilege escalation commands. The attacker was cunning: leveraging “living-off-the-land” binaries like *PowerShell* and scheduled tasks to blend in.

### **Remediation: Closing the Loophole**

After confirming the attack vector and the stolen data path, I:

- Deployed patches to fix the RDP vulnerability.
- Disabled RDP on the affected server indefinitely.
- Removed all malware and suspicious scripts.
- Augmented monitoring, adding advanced Sysmon rules for PowerShell and suspicious process activity.
- Updated firewall rules and SIEM alerting to catch early signs of similar behavior.

### **Lessons Learned: Wisdom Earned on the Front Lines**

- **Patch Management:** Procrastination on updates costs dearly; patching schedules became non-negotiable.
- **Detection Tools:** Deep knowledge of Sysmon filters and Wireshark was invaluable—manual log parsing wasn’t enough.
- **Preparedness:** The incident response plan saved precious minutes and clarified roles.

### **Conclusion: Forged by Adversity**

That first incident was more immersive than any lab exercise—a true test of grit, skills, and composure. It taught me to trust my tools, rely on procedure, and, above all, to keep learning. Every alert since then has drawn on those hard-earned lessons. I’ve responded to dozens of incidents since, but nothing compares to the midnight battle that launched me into the heart of cybersecurity.

If you’re starting your journey, remember: The best tools are useless without understanding and readiness. Practice your filters, know your playbook, and never stop honing your craft. Your first incident might be just around the corner.
